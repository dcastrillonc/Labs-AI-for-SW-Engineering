DEFINITIONS

### Zero-shot Prompting
Zero-shot prompting involves giving an AI model a task without any prior examples or context. The model must rely solely on its pre-trained knowledge to generate a response.

### Few-shot Prompting
Few-shot prompting provides the model with a few examples of the task at hand. This helps the model understand the context and pattern, improving its ability to generate accurate responses.

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
Chain-of-Thought prompting involves guiding the model through a step-by-step reasoning process. This helps in complex problem-solving by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

### Self-Consistency
Self-Consistency in AI prompting refers to generating multiple reasoning paths for a given problem and then selecting the most consistent answer among them. This enhances the reliability of the model’s output.

### Generate Knowledge Prompting
Generate Knowledge Prompting involves creating prompts that help the model generate new information or knowledge based on its existing understanding. This is useful for tasks that require creative or innovative thinking.

### Prompt Chaining
Prompt Chaining connects multiple prompts in a sequence, where the output of one prompt becomes the input for the next. This can help in complex tasks that require multiple stages of reasoning or processing.

### Tree of Thoughts
Tree of Thoughts prompting is a strategy where the model explores different possible reasoning paths (like branches of a tree) to arrive at a solution. This approach helps in considering multiple possibilities before concluding.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with generation. The model retrieves relevant documents or data from a large corpus and uses this information to generate more informed and accurate responses.

### Directional Stimulus Prompting
Directional Stimulus Prompting involves providing directional cues or hints within the prompts to guide the model's response in a specific direction. This can help in steering the model towards more relevant or desired outputs.

### ReAct Prompting
ReAct (Reason and Act) prompting integrates reasoning and action. The model alternates between reasoning steps and actions, allowing it to interact with its environment or data iteratively to achieve a goal.

### Multimodal CoT Prompting
Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting extends the CoT concept to multiple data modalities, such as text, images, and audio. This approach leverages the model’s ability to process and reason across different types of data in a coherent manner.
