For this task, I have chosen to use Gemini Code Assistant within Visual Studio Code as the tool and IDE, respectively. 
Gemini Code Assistant is an AI-powered code completion assistant developed by OpenAI. It is particularly effective in this 
context due to its ability to generate code snippets, provide intelligent suggestions, and offer solutions based on 
extensive training with public code repositories. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) complements Gemini Code Assistant perfectly, 
as it is a versatile, lightweight, and highly extensible code editor that supports a wide range of programming languages and 
tools. The combination of Gemini Code Assistant and VS Code enhances productivity and coding efficiency, allowing for rapid 
development and iteration while maintaining high code quality. This pairing is ideal for both experienced developers looking 
to streamline their workflow and beginners aiming to learn and adopt best coding practices.

FALTA ---> how the assistant helped you, or if it was actually worse.
