For this task, I have chosen to use Gemini Code Assistant within Visual Studio Code as the tool and IDE, respectively. 
Gemini Code Assistant is an AI-powered code completion assistant developed by OpenAI. It is particularly effective in this 
context due to its ability to generate code snippets, provide intelligent suggestions and offer solutions based on 
extensive training with public code repositories. VS Code complements Gemini Code Assistant perfectly, 
as it is a versatile, lightweight and highly extensible code editor that supports a wide range of programming languages and 
tools. The combination of Gemini Code Assistant and VS Code enhances productivity and coding efficiency, allowing for rapid 
development and iteration while maintaining high code quality. This pairing is ideal for both experienced developers looking 
to streamline their workflow and beginners aiming to learn and adopt best coding practices.

The assistant helped me in the area of ​​code generation, review and general programming queries, the assistant proves to be an 
invaluable resource. Effectively generate code, provide comprehensive reviews, and answer questions with detailed explanations 
that close gaps in understanding complex programming concepts. By translating code snippets between languages, suggesting best 
practices and highlighting potential improvements, the assistant improves both the development process and the learning experience. 
This support is particularly useful for developers of all levels, as it facilitates a smoother workflow and a deeper understanding 
of the complexities involved in software development.
