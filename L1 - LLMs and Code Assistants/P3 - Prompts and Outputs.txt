PROMPTS AND OUTPUTS

### Reverse String Function
The `reverse_string(s: str) -> str` function in Python is a straightforward utility for reversing strings. 
When applied, for example, to the string "hello world", it outputs "dlrow olleh". This reversed result is produced 
by Pythonâ€™s slicing mechanism, which, when given the slice notation `[::-1]`, iterates over the string in reverse. 
The output is simple and direct, displaying the reversed string in the console. This function is especially useful 
in contexts where data manipulation or certain string formatting tasks are required.

### UUID Generation Using Python's `secrets` Module
The `generate_uuid()` function utilizes Python's `secrets` module to generate a secure, random UUID. This function 
crafts the UUID by generating 16 bytes of secure random data, which are then converted to a hexadecimal string. 
Each invocation of this function results in a unique and unpredictable UUID string being printed, such as "9fd4b49fe7c64a879f4e2aa79b9c3e28". 
The randomness and security of these UUIDs make them ideal for applications requiring unique identifiers that must also resist prediction and 
duplication, such as in secure transactions or session identifiers in web applications.

### Menu System
The interactive menu system implemented in Python allows users to interactively select from options to display the menu again, 
add numbers, subtract numbers, or quit the program. The output varies based on the user's input:
- **Show Menu**: Clears the screen and displays the menu options again.
- **Add Numbers**: Prompts the user to enter numbers and then displays the sum. For instance, if the user inputs `5` and `3`, the output will be "The sum is: 8".
- **Subtract Numbers**: Similar to addition but for subtraction. If a user enters `10` and `4`, it outputs "The difference is: 6".
- **Quit**: Breaks the loop and ends the program, usually with no additional message unless specifically programmed to notify the user of the program's termination.
